# TypeScript Next.js Google Docs To HTML

Google Account protected HTML generated from google docs

Create a google project with google drive api enable then add `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` as environement variable

Then you can see the document on `/google-doc/xxxxxx` the where `xxxxxx` is the Google docs id

Of course your google account you login with, must have access to the documents.

Just deploy with Zeit for easy and fast configuration
